Reflection
-------------------------------------

Completing this code exercise was quite an experience, it has been a while
since I built something in plain ruby, the projects I have been working on
are rails applications.

This exercise was a great experience for me, when I began I realized a bit of a refresher would be good. I referred back to assignments I had completed at the
beginning of the Web Development Immersive program.

After reviewing my assignments, I decided to write down the important details of
this exercise, I broke down the functions that needed to be performed. Using excel
I figured out the formula to get the correct estimate totals. Next, I identified
the variables, and wrote out how the code should flow, then wrote the methods.
After every method I wrote, I would test it using irb, to catch bugs and ensure
it ran as expected.

My biggest challenge was with TDD using the Minitest framework, it was covered
in the Bitmaker course, but other than the lesson and assignment, I have had little
experience with it. I tested each method as I went using irb, to ensure the
code flowed the way I intended. When it came time to implement Minitest, I
struggled and unfortunately I was unable to successfully complete it in the
time I given myself to finish it. I plan to continue working on getting the Minitest to work after submitting my application. Although it has been a challenge, this 
is a good exercise to help me become more familiar with test frameworks and the TDD process.
